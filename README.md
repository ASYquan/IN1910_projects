### IN1910 â€“ Programming with Scientific Applications 
In this repo, i have imported all my previous submissions or assignments / projects for the course: IN1910 (with a pass of course).
Each of the branches represents one project, where one projects tests our knowledge of different concepts from the curriculum.
Ranging from application of Python / Numpy in pendulum-simulation to implementation of Linked lists (singly and doubly) and arrays with c++. 

# Project 0
First project in IN1910 about testing with pytest and git

-	Notes:
	- During my work with the project i did not realize that i was not supposed to create new files for each of the exercies. 
	As a result, i removed the accidentally created files. In addition i copied  the code in said files, and pasted them in their
	respective files. 
	- I decided to do the changes in the master branch because it was 'easier', and more direct. In addition i did not want to disturb the branch structure previously established. 
	- However, i do realize that it might possibly look more messy in the log and with the commits.
	- 'test_parametrized.py' is the completion of exercise 8 and i decided to make it a seperate 	 	file for easier revision in the future
